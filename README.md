# Overview
This app is meant for upcoming parents who would like to start coming up with names for their future children. This app is very simple to use. After loading it the user will be presented with a text box to enter any names they would like to add and a list of names they have already added. Users will be able to scroll through the list of names and delete names that they do not like.

My purpose in creating this app was to both prepare myself for a future project and do a test run of said project. This future project will be a fully fledged pregnancy app that I will be creating with a group of fellow students in a react framework. One of the features we planned on including was going to be name list. By completing this project I was able to both complete a preliminary attempt at a future project but also obtain the javascript and react skills that would be necessary for this project.

# Future Work
* Formatting is a huge problem right now. The general focus of this project was not to create the best looking app, but to learn the react framework, so as a result there was not enough work put into making this a visually pleasing application.
* In the future I would like to transition the memory storage of this app off of a file and into a cloud database, hopefully learning how to build out a node.js API that connects to a MongoDB database.
* I'd also like to add a navigation bar to the bottom of this app in the future. While the linear nature of the UI features is still easy to use, I would like to seperate these features into two seperate pages.
